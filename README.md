# Code Detective CLI

A CLI to detect syntax errors and other code issues for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, C++, and tax code using static analysis and machine learning.

## Scope

This project aims to provide comprehensive code error detection across multiple programming languages by combining traditional static analysis tools with advanced machine learning models.

## Features

- **Static Analysis:** Uses tools like `pylint`, `flake8`, `mypy`, `eslint`, `cppcheck`, and `clang-tidy`.
- **Machine Learning:** Utilizes transformer models like CodeBERT for deeper code understanding.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Handles Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and C++.
